Notes Font Selector allows you to select the font that is used for an entry's notes.

Per default KeePass only allows you to select fonts for 
* list views like the entry list 
* passwords

If you want a different font for notes and do not want to change this in windows, this plugin is for you.
You can also decide to not show expired entries at all.
